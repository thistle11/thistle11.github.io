    <h3>Market Minute</h3>
    <b>dynaCERT</b>
    <p>
          Let's start from the top. Every year, the TSXV crowns their top 50 listed companies by category, many
          of which go on to become more prominent players in Canada big leagues, the TSX (see X, Y, Z). 
          Share price appreciation and volume, among other factors come in to play while accessing the 
          which companies will make it to the top of the list. 2019's winner? DynaCERT.

  <br><br>Clean tech is so hot right now with everyone looking for a way to clean their disgusting little 
          carbon dicks on some sweet clean vag. dynaCERT is focused on the Diesel market for now but plans
          on making further contributions in the near future and for a time to come.

  <b>Cap and Credit</b>

  <br><br>As many provinces have implemented 'Cap and Trade' policies as a means to reduce carbon emissions
          at the provincial levels, these systems generate Carbon Credits, something that dynaCERT is uniquely
          qualified to take advantage of. DynaCERT claims that they can reduce emission by x and NOX by x while
          making fuel efficient, cash saving improvingment at the same time. D$I$N$G

  <br><br>In an interview, CEO and President Dave Sprolls said "Bitches ain't shit, but who am I?"
  <br><br>Check the chart below for GAINZ.

    <b>Closing</b>

    <br><br>While looking in to the future I see quite an oppurtunity for DYA as they look to enhance their 
            position globally and take a foothold in internatinoal markets. Again, D$I$N$G
