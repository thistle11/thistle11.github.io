          <h2>Canadian Employment Overview</h2>    
          <p> Statistics Canada (or StatsCan) is the Canadian government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better 
              understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Statistics is a federal responsibility in 
              Canada, and Statistics Canada produces statistics for all the provinces as well as the federal government. In addition 
              to conducting about 350 active surveys on virtually all aspects of Canadian life, Statistics Canada undertakes a 
              country-wide census every five years on the first and sixth year of each decade 
              (from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Canada">Statistics Canada, Wikipedia</a>).<br><br> Statistics Canada provides a number of 
              Canadian Income Survey Products. This includes the Canadian Income Survey (CIS)â€”a cross-sectional survey that 
              assesses the income, income sources, and the economic status of individuals and families in Canada. Data from the 
              Labour Force Survey (LFS) is combined with data from the CIS. The February 24, 2020 reported statistics on the Official 
              Poverty Line based on the market basket measure  
              (from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Canada">Statistics Canada, Wikipedia</a>).<br><br>
              The Labour Force Survey and the Canadian Income Survey were the primary data sources used to create the following report. Below
              is a short video explaining some history of the Labour Force Survey and Statistics Canada.

            <h3> Median Income</h3>
            <p>Starting in 1976, StatsCan began collecting income related information from many Canadian households. I will be using this data to examine
              trends over time and see if there are items worth highlighting. As a note, regions that have been left
              out of the StatsCan report are Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavat. Below, see the median income (in 2018 dollars) by province. Median
              income from Canada is included as well.

            <h3> Regional Trends</h3>
            <p>Let's cut out some of the noise and look at a few key areas that are worth comparing. Canada can be looked at as having a few distinct
              regions and I have chosen to break them up into Eastern, Central, and Western. Eastern is comprised of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
              Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Central contains Ontario and Queber while Western is made up of Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan
              and British Columbia. I've left in Canada as an overall aggregate comparison as well. See the chart below for trendlines over time for the
              each region.
