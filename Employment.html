          <h1>Canadian Employment Overview</h1>
          <h2>Data and Statistics</h2>    
          <p> Statistics Canada (or StatsCan) is the Canadian government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better 
              understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Statistics is a federal responsibility in 
              Canada, and Statistics Canada produces statistics for all the provinces as well as the federal government. In addition 
              to conducting about 350 active surveys on virtually all aspects of Canadian life, Statistics Canada undertakes a 
              country-wide census every five years on the first and sixth year of each decade 
              (from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Canada">Statistics Canada, Wikipedia</a>).<br><br> Statistics Canada provides a number of 
              Canadian Income Survey Products. This includes the Canadian Income Survey (CIS)â€”a cross-sectional survey that 
              assesses the income, income sources, and the economic status of individuals and families in Canada. Data from the 
              Labour Force Survey (LFS) is combined with data from the CIS.
              (from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Canada">Statistics Canada, Wikipedia</a>).<br><br>
              The Labour Force Survey and Canadian Income Survey were the primary data sources used to create the following report. Below
              is a short video explaining some history of the Labour Force Survey and Statistics Canada. 
          </p> <br>

            <h2>Income</h2>
            <h3> Median Income</h3>
            <p>Starting in 1976, StatsCan began collecting income related information from many Canadian households. Related to employment, 
              income is an important incentive within the labour market to promote ideals such as innovation, leadership and personal growth. From a personal financial
              perspective the overall objective is to maximize income, generally speaking. From a business perspective,
              employment income is part of labour costs and the overall objective is to reduce income as low as possible without 
              sacrificing quality, again, speaking generally. <br><br>
              
              As a note, regions that have been left out of the Canadian Income Survey 
              report are Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavat, though Canada as a whole has been included. Data collection for this particular
              survey began in 1976. Data used to conduct analysis throughout this report focus on those employed Canadians that are above age 15, 
              irrespective of sex. See below for a provincial breakdown of employment income over time.     
            </p> <br>

            <img class = "content-wrap rplot" src="Rplot_Med_Inc.png" alt="Median Plot" width="800" height="418.40490797546">
          </div><br>
            <h3> Regional Trends</h3>
            <p>Let's cut out some of the noise and look at a few key areas that are worth comparing. Canada can be looked at as having a 
              few distinct regions and I have chosen to break them up into Eastern, Central, and Western. Eastern is comprised of Nova Scotia, 
              New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Central contains Ontario and Quebec while Western is made up of Alberta, 
              Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. I've left in Canada as an overall aggregate comparison as well. See the chart below 
              for trendlines over time for the each region. If it's not visually apparent, relative to constant 2018 dollar (this surveys endpoint),
              in terms of median employment income, Canada has not made much in terms of progress or growth over this 40+ year period as a whole
              though some regions (Atlantic in particular) have gained a lot of ground over time relative to other areas. 
            </p> <br>

          </div><br>
           <h2>Employment Sectors</h2>
           <h3> Proportional Growth</h3>
           <p> Rather than looking at things through a regional lens, let's look at individual sectors over time. Broadly speaking, sectors can 
             be categorized as service producing (ex. Administration) or goods producing (ex. Manufacturing). In this analysis we've decided to look at one
             level of granularity beyond these broad levels. See below for a relative measure of sector growth over time as well as overall sector 
             growth since 1976.
           </p> <br>
            <iframe class= "content-wrap plot" 
                   src="https://public.tableau.com/views/EmploymentSectors/SectorProportions?:retry=yes&:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"
                   width="800" height="525">
           </iframe><br>
           <h3> Relative Weight </h3>
           <p> Looking at data over time will allow us to observe trendlines. Using the same data as above, we'll now look at the relative
             proportional value of each sector from 1976 to 2019. <br><br>

             Three relevant sectors that have either made considerable change or are or particular interest are:<br>
             1. Manufacturing - falling from 19.1% to 9.1%, a 10% decline<br>
             2. Health Care - rising from 8.1% to 13.1%, a 5% increase<br>
             3. Professional, Scientific, Technical - rising from 2.6% to 8.2%, a 5.6% increase<br>
           </p> <br>
            <iframe class= "content-wrap plot" 
                   src="https://public.tableau.com/views/EmploymentSectors/ProportionalChange?:retry=yes&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"
                   width="800" height="525">
           </iframe><br>
           <h3> Employment Sector Table</h3>
           <p>For a closer look at each sector weight relative to total employment over time, see the chart below: 
           </p> <br>
           <iframe class= "content-wrap plot" 
                   src="https://public.tableau.com/views/EmploymentSectors/ProportionalTable?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"
                   width="800" height="525">
           </iframe><br><br>
           <h2>Employment Class</h2>
           <h3> Class Categories</h3>
           <p>Employment classes can be broken down in to two broad categories: Employees and Self-Employed. Within the two categories, many 
             distictions can be made (are you self employed and employ someone else?), but for the sake of our anaylsis, we will simply be
             looking at these two broad categories. Again, using the same parameters as previuosly: 15 years and older, both sexes, employed
             individuals. See graph below.
           </p> <br>
           <img class = "content-wrap rplot" src="Rplot_Emp_Class.png" alt="Employment Class Plot" width="800" height="418.40490797546"><br>
           <h3> Employment Class - Relative</h3>
           <p>This chart may look a bit misleading upon first glance. It would appear as though employees have far outpaced the growth rate of 
             the self employed. See the chart below for a relative weight of these two categories. <br><br>

             A few relevant observations of interest are:<br>
             1. In 1976, self employment rates were first measured at 12.2% <br>
             2. Self employment peaked in 1998 at 17.2%<br>
             3. After 1998, self employment rates have stedily decreased to 15.2% in 2019<br>
             
            </p> <br>
           <img class = "content-wrap rplot" src="Rplot_Rel_Emp.png" alt="Employment Class Plot" width="800" height="418.40490797546">
           <br>
           <h2>Summary of Observations</h2>
           <h3> Canadian Employment Overview</h3>
           <p> The Canadian employment landscape is vast and in a state of continuos adaptation. Variance in regional employment as well as 
              a focus on the sector breakdown reveal changes over time in the workplace, which could be extrapolated in to the future, with further 
              analysis. Though this analysis is admittedly narrow, it would appear as though employment class is consistent over time 
              relative to other factors in Canada, but more analysis would need to be taken to clarify underlying reasons, drivers, and 
              correlations. <br><br>

           For addition insight and depth, further analysis and research can be conducted in the following areas, among others: self employment 
           income, global trends in employment, global trends in income, income sources beyond employment, part-time/full-time work, 
           contract work, employee benefits, etc.
